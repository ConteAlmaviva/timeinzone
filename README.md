Addon for Ashita v3, displays time in current zone. When initially loaded, this will show "time since addon loaded" because it relies on seeing the zone in packet to set the base time, which it won't see if the addon is loaded after you're already in a zone. If you enter a BCNM arena, it will update to show the time since you entered the BC; it will revert back to the time since you entered the zone when you leave the arena.
